Subdivision Select
===

*subdivision_select* is a Rails engine that provides a select form helper that
automatically loads subdivisions (states/provinces) of a country into a select
box. It works via AJAX, but doesn't require you to write any javascript.

'subdivisions' are also referred to as 'states' or 'provinces'. The terminology
comes from ISO 3166-2. This data is provided by the `countries` gem, via the
`country_select` gem.

Please open a new Github Issue for any problems you have with the gem. Bugs
reports and feature requests are always welcome, but I'm also willing to do tech
support or ways you think the code quality can be improved.
